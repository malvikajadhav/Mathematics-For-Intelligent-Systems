## Homework 1
### Problem statement A.1.2
Creating vectors in Julia. In each of the parts below, use Julia to create the described vector a. In
each case, check that aTx gives the correct result, for a random vector x.<br>
(a) aTx extracts (is equal to) the 5th entry of the 10-vector x.<br>
(b) aTx is the weighted average of a 3-vector x, assigning weights 0.3 to the first component, 0.4
to the second, and 0.3 to the third.<br>
(c) aTx (with x a 22-vector) is the sum of xi for i a multiple of a 4, minus the sum of xi for i a
multiple of 7.<br>
(d) aTx (with x an 11-vector) is the average of the middle five entries of x, i.e., entries 4 to 8.<br>

### Problem statement A.1.6
A particular computer can compute the inner product of two 106-vectors in around 0.001 second.
The same computer can compute the inner product of two 107-vectors in (approximately) how
long?
